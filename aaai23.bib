abstract="Images have been of utmost importance in the life of humans as vision is one of the most important sense, therefore, images play a vital role in every individual's perception. As a result, image processing from its very first application in the 1920s to till date has advanced many folds. There are various fields in which image processing flourished but one of the major and upcoming field is Medical Science. There has been a dramatic expansion in Medical Image Processing in last two decades due to its ever-increasing and non-ending applications. The main reason that the field evolved in such short time is because of its interdisciplinary nature, it attracts expertise from different background like Computer Science, Biotechnology, Statistics, Biology, etc. Computerised Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-Ray, Gamma Ray, and Ultrasound are some of the commonly used medical imaging technologies used today. The rush in the development of new technology demands to meet the challenges faced such as---how to improve the quality of an image, how to automate medical imaging and predictions, and how to expand its reach to all medical fields. The sole and only purpose of this chapter is to provide an introduction to medical image application and techniques so that more interest can be developed for further research in the same field.",

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to },
